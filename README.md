# RFM Analysis
In this project, we will dive into a RFM analysis using Python.

A business can evaluate a customer's recency (the date of their most recent purchase), frequency (the frequency of their purchases), and monetary value (the amount spent on purchases) using RFM Analysis, a concept used by Data Science professionals, particularly in the marketing domain. 

Recency, frequency, and monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
